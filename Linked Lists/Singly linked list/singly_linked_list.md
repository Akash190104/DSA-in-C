#singly linked list

A singly linked list is a linked list where traversal can be done in the forward direction only due to the linking of every node to the next node.

There are some basic operations that can be performed on a singly linked list. They are

- insertion of node at beginning of list
- insertion of node at the end of a list
- insertion of node at any specific position in the list

- deletion of node at beginning of list
- deletion of node at the end of a list
- deletion of node at any specific position in the list

Before doing any of that you need to create a linked list. So that you can perform such operations.
